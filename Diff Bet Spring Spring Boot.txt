Spring and SpringBoot :

Spring  :
- To create a Spring application, the developers write lots of code.
- Developers need to write boilerplate code for smaller tasks.
- Developers have to define dependencies manually in the pom.xml file.
- To run the Spring application, we need to set the server explicitly.
- It helps to create a loosely coupled application.
- The most important feature of the Spring Framework is dependency injection.
- Spring is an open-source lightweight framework widely used to develop enterprise applications.
- in spring we used @Controller Annotation
- in spring we cannot used @CrossOrigin Annotation to connect the fronted Framework(such as Angular / React)


Spring Boot :
- It reduces the lines of code.
- In Spring Boot, there is reduction in boilerplate code.
- pom.xml file internally handles the required dependencies
- Spring Boot provides embedded servers such as Tomcat and Jetty etc.
- It helps to create a stand-alone application.
- The most important feature of the Spring Boot is Autoconfiguration.
- Spring Boot is built on top of the conventional spring framework, widely used to develop REST APIs.
- in Spring Boot we used @RestController Annotation
- in springBoot we can used @CrossOrigin Annotation to connect the fronted Framework(such as Angular/ React)
