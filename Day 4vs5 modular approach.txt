1 Modular Approach :

The modular approach in Java is a way to design software by breaking it into independent modules, or parts, that can communicate with each other through an interface.
This approach can help make software more maintainable, reusable, and easier to update.

2 Implementation of Dao (DATA ACCESS LAYER/OBJ)

The DAO pattern is an approach to organize the database Connection layer in an application, separating data access operations from business logic.
 
 Dao Class = Database connection information
 Service Class = business logic
 Controller Class = calling functionality 

Flow of Executions :

Controller receives the request and sends data to the Service layer.
Service applies business logic and calls the DAO.
DAO interacts with the database and returns the result to the Service.
Service formats the result and sends it to the Controller.
Controller returns the final result to the User.
