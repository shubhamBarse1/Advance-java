
*) Stages of objects in hibernate :
 
-Transient    - object is before associated 
-Persistent   - object is associated with a session
-Detached     - object has been detached from session
-Remove       - object has been removed

*) (Hibernate.cfg.xml) file :

- the configuration file contains database connection details, mapping resourse and other required by hibernate setting, also    
  contains Dialect information. 
- hibernate mapping file are xml files that defines the mapping between  java classes and database tables, they specify how each        
  property of a java class is map to a column in a database table.


*) Dialect :

- A dialect in hibernate is class that acts as a bridge between java JDBC type and SQL type.


Configuration (class) :

- the configuration is class present in org.hibernate package
- the configuration class represent the configuration setting for hibernate ,such as database connection properties, mapping files 
or Annotation and other environment specific configuration.


SessionFactory (Interface) :

- the sessionfacotry it is an interface present in org.hibernate package.
- session factory provides the instance(objects) of session
- it is a factory of session, and client of connection provider
- it holds second level cache of data.

Session (Interface) : 

- it is an interface present in org.hibernate package package.
- it maintain a connection between the hibernate application and database
- it provides methods to store, update, delete or fetch data from the database such as persist(),remove(),merge(),update(),save(),   get(),load()....
- it is a factory of Query , criteria and Transaction e.i it provides factory methods to return this instance.


Transaction (Interface) :

- the Transaction is an interface present in org.hibernate package
- it represent a database transaction in hibernate
- it provides methods to begin , commit and rollback transactions.
