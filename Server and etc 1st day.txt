Types of Application

 - Stand alone Application :(without internet running)

		 1 GUI Based Application/Desktop (Graphical User Interface Based)
			e.g. Calculator
		 2 CUI Based Application-(Character User Interface Based)
		 e.g. All core java Application which are running from Command prompt is a CUI Based
		 Also Called Console Application.

- Web Application :(server side technologies run this application)

		- for example : www.google.com
                - A software that runs in your web browser.
                - A web Application is application software that is accessed using a web browser. web  
                  application are delivered on World Wide Web to users with an active network connection.                             
		- java enterprise application - Bank Application, Telecom Application.
		- means it support ATM, smart device, It is combination of all things(Multiple services) like     
                  Bank Application.


2 Server : (Apache tomcat server version 10.1)

A server is an software and hardware device. that accepts and respond to request made over network by the client.
- A web server is a computer system capable of delivering web content to end users over the internet via a web browser.
Examples : 
1 H/w Server - physical Machine(It has one or more S/W server run with differentiate using port)
2 S/W Server
- Web Server - IIS (Microsoft),Glassfish (sun Microsystem),Tomcat server(Apache), Jetty.
			
- Application Server - mysql, Angular server, Oracle server WebLogic, Jboss ,wildfly (Red Hat),IBM WebSphere
- one port has one application only.



3 HTTP protocol: (Hypertext transfer protocol)
	- protocol => It is set of rule 
	HTTP is stateless protocol-
   HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that the connection between the browser and the server is lost once the transaction ends.
	
4 Http Request & HTTP Response

	- HTTP follows Request-Response model.


	1) HTTP Request = Req headers + Req body

	Headers:
			Req Method = GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/HEAD/TRACE/OPTIONS
			Url = resource identifier
			HTTP version =  1.1
			Browser language = en
			Client/Browser = IP address
			Content Type = type of data
				text
					text/plain, text/xml, "text/html"
				image
					image/jpeg, image/png, ...
				audio
					audio/mp3, audio/wav, ...
				video
					video/mpeg, ...

				application

					application/json, application/pdf, ...
					
			Content Length = num of bytes in body
			Cookies
			User-Agent = Browser details
	Body:
			data 
				e.g. form data -- in 
key=value pair.
				e.g. JSON data


     2) HTTP Response = Resp headers + Resp body	
		  Headers:

			HTTP version=1.0/1.1
			Content-Type= type of data in resp body.
			Content-Length= num of bytes in resp body.
			Status code & message


			
		*) HTTP Status code:

	1 2xx 200-299 --> success e.g. 200 (success/OK)
	2 3xx 300-399 --> redirection e.g. 302 (http redirection)resource move to other ...
	3 4xx 400-499 --> client side errors e.g. 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), 400 (Bad Request) ...
        4 5xx 500-599 --> server errors Whenever there is problem on server side this series is used ....			
			
			
			Server info = IP address
			Cookies
		Body:
			data
				e.g. HTML tags
				e.g. JSON data

		
5 Http Methods :

	1 get method => it fetch a data from backend server 
	2 post => it sends a data from front end server to backend server 
	3 put => It is used to update a particular record 
	4 delete => It is used to delete a particular record 


6 Server-client establishment/ Flow / how server-client application work

in a client-server application.
a client sends an http request to a web server. which then pass the request to the corresponding servlet.
servlet process the request and generate a response.
client browser see the response on the screen.(output)
