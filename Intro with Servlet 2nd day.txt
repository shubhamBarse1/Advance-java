                                  Introduction with Servlet :


-it is an API(Application Programming Interface) for java Language.
-Servlet is a server side technology.
-Which is used to handle the client request. process the request and generate the dynamic response.
-A servlet are used to handle dynamic content on web server.
-they are platform independent and follows the java EE specification.
-servlet technology is an robust and scalable because of java language.
-there are many interface and classes in the servlet API such as Servlet, GenericServlet, HttpServlet...
-the servlet defines lifecycle methods are init(), service(),destroy(). 
-server-side technology used to create dynamic web applications.
-Servlets are Java classes that run in a web server and can respond to client(Browser) requests, typically over HTTP. They are part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform and provide a powerful way to handle requests, manage sessions, and generate responses like HTML, XML, or JSON.

-Servlets follow the request-response model and interact with web clients through a HttpServletRequest (request) (which encapsulates client request information) and HttpServletResponse (response) (which allows the servlet to generate a response).


* Servlet Lifecycle :

1) Servlet is loaded
2) Servlet is Instantiated
3) Servlet is Initialized (init)
4) Service the Request(Request Handling) (service)
5) Servlet is Destroyed (destroy)
 

* A simple servlet lifecycle consists of:

Initialization (init())     : This method is called once when the servlet is initialized. (Return type: void).

Request handling (service()): This method is called for each client request and is responsible for handling the request and generating            
                              a response.  (Return type: void).
             
Termination (destroy())     : when the server is shutdown destroy method is invoked and servlet object is destroy.
                             This method is called once when the servlet is about to be destroyed. (Return type: void).



GenericServlet :

1) Generic servlet is protocol independent.
2) it can be used with any protocol such as HTTPS,SMTP,FTP...
3) the service method is abstract.
4) request and response objects is not present.

HttpServlet :

1) http servlet is protocol dependent.
2) it can be used with only http protocol.
3) the service method is non-abstract.
4) request and response objects is present.


summary & Interview Questions 

1) What is Servlet 
2) Explain lifecycle of servlet
3) Explain lifecycle methods of servlet
4) how many objects of servlet is created ? when servlet object is created
-(only one object at the time of first request by the servlet).
5) Diff betn GenericServlet and HttpServlet ?
6) where we can create html file = (Webapp/WEBINF)
