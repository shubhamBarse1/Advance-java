Todays Lecture Agenda :

CriteriaBuilder: Creates a CriteriaQuery.
CriteriaQuery: Defines the structure of the query.
Root: Specifies the entity from which to start querying.
Query: Executes the constructed query and retrieves the result.


Criteria (Interface) :

it is an interface present in org.hibernate package/jakarta.persistent package
the object of criteria used for the creation and execution of the object oriented criteria queries.



Session and SessionFactory :

session :
- it represent database connection 
- it holds the first -level cache(L1 cache) of data / it enable by default
- it is short lived
- it is available for particular transaction 

sessionfactory :
- it is factory class for session
- it holds the second -level cache(L2 cache) of data / it is not enable by default 
- it is long lived
- it is available for the whole application


HQL (Hibernate Query Language) :

- HQL stands for hibernate query language. it is also called as object oriented query language.it is like as structure query language(SQL). it uses an objects of POJO class.


*) Stages of objects in hibernate :
 
-Transient    - object is before associated 
-Persistent   - object is associated with a session
-Detached     - object has been detached from session
-Remove       - object has been removed


diff betn Get() and Load() methods : 

get() :
- return null if an object is not found
- get method always hit the database
- it return the real objects not proxy object
- it should be used if you are not sure about the existance of instance

Load() : 
- throws object not found Exception if an object is not found
- load method does not hit the database
- it returns proxy objects
- it should be used if you are sure that instance exits


Summary and Interview Question 

- How to Integrate hibernate in eclipse
- what is criteria?
- Diff betn session and sessionfactory
- what is HQL?/ how is HQL query created / diff betn HQL and SQL 
- Diff betn Get() and Load() method in hibernate
- is Session factory/Session is thread safe objects => YES many threads cannot access it simultaneously / Session => No
