Spring :

modules :
- Beans
- IOC 
- Context
- DI
- Auto-wiring   - @Autowired 
- Annotations   - @Component , @Componentscan, @Autowired ,@Qualifier , @Bean  , @Configuration , @Values , @Scope


Spring Boot :

  - Spring Boot is an open-source framework built on top of the Spring Framework for Java developers.
  - Spring Boot was developed by Pivotal Software (now part of VMware). It was first released in 2014. 
  - in Spring Boot 'Boot' (fast) refers to the concept of rapidly initiating a spring application by handling 
    all essentials set ups and configurations.

  - Spring Boot makes building Spring Applications easier and faster


core principle of Spring Boot :
 - Opiniated Default : 
    - Maven/Gradle 
    - Dependency
    - project structure
    - Application.properties
 
- Convention over Configurations :

     - Used Annotation 

 @Controller = calling functinality,
 @Service    = business logic,
 @Repository = Dao (database connections details)
 @Entity     = (get fields from frontend)     

- Auto-Configuration :
    - automatically manage / no need to create xml files

- Embedded Server :
   - used automatically server(tomcat)



 - use of Spring Boot :
    - Web Applications
    - RESTful APIs creation
    - microservices
    - batch processing
    - integration with other technologies .. react/angular ORM ...etc
    - Testing


1 Http Request & Http Response
	Http Request => 2 Part 
	1 Header
		- URI
		- ip
		- method => get/post/put/delete
		- ContentType
			- image 
			- Audio
			- text 
			- Video
			- Json 
			- PDF
		- Date time 
		- Auth token 
	2 Body 
		Data 
			1 Json 
			2 text 
			
Http Response => 2 Part 
	1 Header
		- URI
		- ip
		- method => get/post/put/delete
		- ContentType
			- image 
			- Audio
			- text 
			- Video
			- Json 
			- PDF
		- Date time 
		- Auth token 
		- Status code 
			1 2xx => success/ok 200-299
			2 3xx => Redirection => 300-399
			3 4xx=> client side error => 400-499
			4 5xx=> Server side error => 500-599
	2 Body 
		Data 
			1 Json 
			2 text 
		
2 Rest Vs Soap
+ REST 
	- Typically REST works on top of HTTP protocol
	- Can be accessed from any device which has internet connection.
	- REST is lightweight (than SOAP)
		- gives freedom -- XML or JSON -- JSON is preferred.
		- JSON processing is lighter.
		- JSON needs less data
                - Data sent in JSON format

+ SOAP 
	- SOAP services gives XML data 
	- Can be accessed & processing XML data needs more device config.
		- XML processing is heavy
		- XML needs more data
                - Data sent in XML format

3 JSON Object :

	Java script Object Notation 
	- It store data into key & value Format
	
	{
		"id":"120",
		"fname":"harshad",
		"lname":"tttt"
	}

@Entity	
class Employee {

	int id;
	String fname;
	String lname;
	Date date;
}

{
	"id":9,
	"fname":"gfgf",
	"lname":"",
	"date":"...."
	
}
	
	
	
4 Array Of Object :
	
	[
		{
			"id":"9",
			"fname":"Sumit",
			"lname":"...."
		},
		{
			"id":"10",
			"fname":"Sumit",
			"lname":"...."
		},
		{
			"id":"6",
			"fname":"Sumit",
			"lname":"...."
		}
	]
