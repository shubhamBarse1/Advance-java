
Todays Lecture Agenda :


1) Web.xml file/Deployment Descriptive file :

- the web xml file is also called as deployment descriptive file 
- we create an web.xml file in WEBINF folder
- in latest version it is not compulsory to create xml file
- in latest version we used the @webservlet annotation on the class.


2) @WebServlet Annotation :

- this annotation is used only for servlet class level.
-The @WebServlet annotation is used in Java Servlets to declare a servlet without needing to define it in the web.xml file. It simplifies the configuration process by allowing you to directly map a servlet to a specific URL pattern within the servlet class.
- it is an exactly replacement of web.xml file/ deployment descriptive file

http GET() :

1) limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header
2) not secure because data is exposed in URL bar
3) can be bookmarked
4) it is more efficient
5) get is slightly faster

http POST() :

1) large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body
2) secured because data is not exposed in URL
3) cannot be bookmarked
4) it is less efficient
5) post is slightly slower


doGet() : is used to handle HTTP GET request. used for retrieving data from the server.

Note : By default html call Get method.
