*) DriverManager class :

Jdbc DriverManager is an class in java.
which is present in java sql package.
it is used to establish the connection between database and Driver.  
the DriverManager class is acts like as an interface between the User and Driver.
it contains several methods to keep the interactions between the User and Driver like as GetConnection() ...


*) Connection interface :

Connection is interface which is present in java sql package.
the connection interface maintain a session with the database, it can be used for transaction management.
it provides the factory methods that returns the instance of Statement and Preparedstatement.
it also provides methods for Trasactions management such as commit(),rollback(), close() etc ...


PreparedStatement extends Statement {

}


2 What is Statement interface ?

- Statement is an interface that present in java.sql.* package.
- Its main purpose to represents SQL Statement & execute query with the database.
- It compiled & execute every time for each query
- it is used when sql query is to be executed only once.
- you cannot pass the paramenter at runtime.
- it is base interface.
- used to execute normal sql queries.
- performance is very low.
- it is used for DDL statement.
- in statement may be possibility of sql injection attacks.
- It contains different methods like execute(),executeQuery(),executeUpdate().
	

	- Each methods has its own functionality :

- execute() methods used to perform DDL oeprations like create,drop,and truncate the table & it returns only boolean value either true or false to validate table status changes.

- executeQuery() methods used to perform DQL operations like select table data & it returns ResultSet Object, with the help of ResultSet Object we can get data from database

- executeUpdate() methods used to perform DML operations like insert, delete & update & it returns a interger value. That meaning is row is upadated successfully.

	
3) PreparedStatement interface :

- PreparedStatement is an interface that present in java.sql.* package
- PreparedStatement is inhertaded the Statement Interface , it can do what a Statement can do, plus more
- PreparedStatement Object represents a precompiled SQL statement. Means When PreparedStatement is created, the SQL query is passed as a parameter. This Prepared Statement contains a pre-compiled SQL query, so you can be be used to execute the statement multiple times.
- it is used when sql queries is to be executed multiple times.
- you can pass parameter at runtime.
- it extends statement interface.
- it is used to execute dynamic sql queries.
- performance is better than statements.
- it is used for any sql query.
- in preparedstatement there is no possibility of sql injections attacks.
- it contains same methods as statement like as execute(),executeQuery(),executeUpdate().


ResultSet interface :

- it is an interface present in java sql package.
- it represent that database resultset.
- the Resultset objects represent a row of a table.
- by using the next() method we fetch the data one by one.
- the return type of the next() method is Boolean.
- A resultset always maintain the connection with database.
- it cannot be serialize.

RowSet Interface :

- it is an interface present in java sql package.
- jdbc rowset is wrapper of resultset.
- it holds tabular data like resultset, but it is easy and flexible to used.
- a rowset can be connected/disconnected from the database.
- rowset objects can be serialize.
